# FedEx-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Project Summary
FedEx Logistics operates within a complex and rapidly evolving global supply chain environment, where efficiency, visibility, and cost optimization are critical to maintaining competitive advantage. As global commerce expands and customer expectations rise, the ability to manage international shipments with precision has become essential. This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive logistics dataset that captures end-to-end shipment processes, providing insights into purchase orders, transportation modes, vendor agreements, delivery timelines, and product-specific characteristics. The goal is to leverage this dataset to enhance operational performance, identify inefficiencies, and support data-driven supply chain decision-making.

At the core of the dataset is detailed purchase order and shipment information, including PO numbers, price quotations, sales orders, and Advanced Shipment Notices. These fields establish the commercial and operational foundation for each transaction, enabling analysts to trace how orders progress from creation to final delivery. Complementing these are critical timeline variables—such as the dates when purchase orders were sent to vendors, scheduled delivery dates, actual delivery dates, and recorded delivery confirmations. Together, these elements allow for precise measurement of on-time performance, delay analysis, and lead-time variability.

A key component of global logistics is the adherence to INCO terms, which define the responsibilities and risk allocation between buyers and vendors. The dataset includes vendor-specified INCO terms (e.g., EXW, FCA, CIF), allowing analysts to understand how handoff points and liability obligations impact transit times, freight costs, and delivery reliability. These terms also directly influence the shipment mode, with records specifying whether items were shipped via air, ocean, ground, or multimodal combinations. Shipment mode selections are critical for evaluating trade-offs between cost, speed, and cargo characteristics.

The dataset also provides granular detail on product and item attributes, including dosage forms, molecule/test type, product group classifications, brand, and manufacturing site. In industries such as pharmaceuticals, where many FedEx Logistics clients operate, product characteristics directly influence packaging, handling, customs requirements, and delivery urgency. Fields such as unit price, pack price, unit of measure, and line item value allow for robust cost analytics at both the product and shipment levels. These variables support financial assessments such as freight-to-value ratios, product profitability, and cost-per-unit-delivered comparisons across vendors and regions.

Operational efficiency is further evaluated through metrics related to freight cost, insurance cost, shipment weight, and vendor performance. By connecting cost data with timelines and outcomes, the dataset enables the identification of bottlenecks, cost drivers, and inefficiencies. Analysts can examine whether certain vendors consistently lead to delays, whether specific shipping modes result in higher freight expenditure, or how manufacturing location affects scheduling accuracy and delivery speed. Additionally, the dataset captures management ownership—such as which internal FedEx team oversees each shipment—providing another dimension for operational accountability and performance benchmarking.

With its breadth of fields spanning commercial, operational, logistical, and product-specific dimensions, the dataset offers an invaluable opportunity to conduct deep supply chain diagnostics. Insights derived from this analysis can support improvements in forecasting, vendor selection, shipment planning, and customer service. Moreover, by identifying patterns in delays, cost anomalies, or underperforming routes, FedEx Logistics can refine its global logistics strategy to better meet customer demands while controlling expenses.

Ultimately, this project aims to transform raw logistics data into actionable intelligence. Through comprehensive analysis, FedEx Logistics can streamline operations, enhance delivery reliability, optimize freight spend, and strengthen its ability to manage the complexities of international distribution in an increasingly competitive global market.
